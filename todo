ISSUE - recent-activities doesn't get songs for activities from over a day ago
Fix the recently played page to show activities over the previous weeks
- make it look nice too

Change name of page to MoovIt



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build static html pages, populate the fields using response data
- display songs as playable items
- display the strava activity map 

Find playlists based on playback time instead of scanning over songs since activity start

Add the option of creating a spotify playlist from an activity's song list

BONUS: create option to overlay stats over a photo of users choice
