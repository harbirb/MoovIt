Change name of page to MoovIt

Apply to Strava so friends can try it out
- need to add "View on Strava" link for all activities



ISSUE - recent-activities doesn't get songs for activities from over a day ago
- Limitation of Spotify API, only stores a limited number of songs???



Fix the recently played page to show activities over the previous weeks
- make it look nice too

Set an alert for API overload response

create new strava client for dev purposes (no need for spotify since it can have several callback domains)

Create FAQ on main page
- why are some songs not showing up
- how 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create caching ability to limit API calls to spotify, store as activity-playlist objects

Build static html pages, populate the fields using response data
- display songs as playable items
- display the strava activity map 

Find playlists based on playback time instead of scanning over songs since activity start

Add the option of creating a spotify playlist from an activity's song list

BONUS: create option to overlay stats over a photo of users choice
